A budgeting app around the idea of saving money on a monthly basis by never spending more money
in a month than you make in a month.

### Monthly Ledger
Tacks all income and keeps a running tally of it against any purchases or expenses
so you can see where your stand for the month
### Daily Cashflow
Helps track if your account will go under at any time during the month
based on predicting income
### Cash Card
Once a budget is established the app helps setup the amount that should be in your open
spending 'cash/cash-card' account.

### Forking
